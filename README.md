# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Thank you for reviewing my project! Below is my README.md, which gives an overview of files in my GitHub repo and links to other files in my repo. I also provide a critique on my analysis and file storage in this project and this repo.

## Analysis and File Storage

### My analysis on this project has been straightforward. I order my code systematically and I comment code my work to denote each question and its appropriate solution. I also make it clear in my comment code where I use certain code blocks. Using GIT, I write lengthy commit messages to make it clear where my code is being updated and to maintain the readability of my repo. 

### My file storage has also been organized. All files are intuitively named and appropriately labeled. I have made it clear where to find certain files and certain pieces of code. I, however, did not feel the need to create folders to distinguish certain file groups (such as R packages, files, and markdown files).

## In this GitHub repo, you will find:

 - ### A [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/RitCh123/tidydata/blob/main/run_analysis.R) file that gives the code for processing, organizing, and cleaning the data from text files.
 - ### A [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/RitCh123/tidydata/blob/main/CodeBook.md) file that gives a thorough description of my code, variable usability, transformations in my code and that data, and additoinal necessary information.
 - ### A complete [tidy dataset](https://github.com/RitCh123/tidydata/blob/main/tidySet.txt) that gives the complete data set after processing and cleaning. This is the final result of the project (after step #5)
